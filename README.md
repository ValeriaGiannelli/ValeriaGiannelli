# Hi there! 👋

I'm **Vale**, a junior full stack developer with a passion for **Vue**, **Laravel**, **JavaScript**, and **PHP**.

- 💻 I love working on user-centered projects and making web apps more intuitive.
- 🔍 Debugging is my superpower! I’m always up for a challenge to hunt down those pesky bugs.
- 🎉 And yes, I’m a big fan of GIFs! Here's a fun one that represents me:

Feel free to reach out or check out my work on GitHub. Happy coding! 🚀
